# Webpage censor chrome extension

A minimalistic Chrome extension that censors specific words on any website or censor the whole page with the specific words. The extension scans the content of web pages and replaces predefined words with a censorship indicator (e.g., asterisks or black bars). Designed for simplicity, it features a modern interface and supports dynamic content updates for words added or removed during browsing sessions.
